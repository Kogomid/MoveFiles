# MoveFiles
File Organizer Console Application

This repository contains a C# console application designed to help users organize their files by moving them from a common "downloads" directory into categorized subdirectories. The application sorts files based on their file type, such as documents, programs, videos, photos, compressed files, and music.

Features

    Interactive Menu: Users are presented with a simple text-based menu to select the type of files they want to organize.
    Customizable Download Path: The path to the downloads directory can be set and changed by the user.
    File Categorization: Files are moved into folders named after their category, making it easier to find specific types of files.
    Duplicate Handling: The application checks for existing files in the destination directory and skips the move if a duplicate is found, preventing overwrites.
    User Feedback: After each operation, the application provides feedback on the number of files moved and skipped.

How to Use

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Compile the application using your preferred C# development environment.
    Run the executable from the command line or through your development environment.
